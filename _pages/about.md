I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I work with [Prof. Ling Liu](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/lingliu/) and [Prof. Calton Pu](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~calton/) at the [Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab (DiSL)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/disl/). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor's degree with **honors** in Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
